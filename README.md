# Speech-to-Speech Smart Speaker

This is the Python code for a smart speaker (like the Amazon Echo or Google Home) that is built atop [OpenAI's Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime). This speech-to-speech API is more conversational and lower latency than traditional voice assistants, such as Alexa.

This is an open-source project, and all improvements are welcome! Please submit pull requests. Let's build the future of ambient intelligence together.
